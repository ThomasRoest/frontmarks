# Frontmarks

Cureated frontend resources collection.

Available at [frontmarks.com](https://frontmarks.com)

## Contribution

There are 2 potential ways to contribute to the project:

1. You can [open an issue](https://github.com/BananaBobby/frontmarks/issues/new) with the resource or section you want to have on the website.
2. You can send a pull request to the repo with the proposed changes to `src/data` files.

#### General contribution rules

- I'm trying to keep the resource minimalistic, so let's not add any link related to frontend, but rather focus on quality of the resources.
- If you want to add a new section, please search for resources that fall into it. Each section should have at least 8 resources to start with.
- Project is surely open for contributions outside of data scope. So if you want to discuss any UI feature - create an issue and we'll discuss how to move on.
